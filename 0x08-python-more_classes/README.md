# 0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects
## Project Requirements
### Python Scripts
- Formatted with PEP8 style standards
- Compiled with `python3`
- All files must be executable
### Python Test Cases
- All test files must be inside `tests` folder
- All test files must be .txt files
- All test files must be executed using `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- All modules should have a documentation `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
- All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- All functions should have a documentation `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`

## File Descriptions
**0-rectangle.py:** an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle

**1-rectangle.py:** a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by width and height

**2-rectangle.py:** a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by width and height and returns area and perimeter

**3-rectangle.py:** a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by width and height and returns area and perimeter and prints the rectangle

**4-rectangle.py:** a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by width and height and returns area and perimeter, prints the rectangle, and returns a string representation to be able to recreate a new instance by using eval()

**5-rectangle.py:** a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by width and height and returns area and perimeter and prints the rectangle, returns a string representation to be able to recreate a new instance by using eval(), and prints "Bye rectangle..." when an instance of Rectangle is deleted

**6-rectangle.py:** a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by width and height and returns area and perimeter and prints the rectangle, returns a string representation to be able to recreate a new instance by using eval(), counts number of instances of rectangle, and prints "Bye rectangle..." when an instance of Rectangle is deleted

**7-rectangle.py:** a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by width and height and returns area and perimeter and prints the rectangle, returns a string representation to be able to recreate a new instance by using eval(), counts number of instances of rectangle, allows symbol used to print rectangle to be set, and prints "Bye rectangle..." when an instance of Rectangle is deleted

**8-rectangle.py:** a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by width and height and returns area and perimeter and prints the rectangle, returns a string representation to be able to recreate a new instance by using eval(), counts number of instances of rectangle, allows symbol used to print rectangle to be set, prints "Bye rectangle..." when an instance of Rectangle is deleted, and has a static method that returns the biggest rectangle based on area

**9-rectangle.py:** a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by width and height and returns area and perimeter and prints the rectangle, returns a string representation to be able to recreate a new instance by using eval(), counts number of instances of rectangle, allows symbol used to print rectangle to be set, prints "Bye rectangle..." when an instance of Rectangle is deleted, has a static method that returns the biggest rectangle based on area, and has a class method that returns a new Rectangle instance where width/height/size are the same
